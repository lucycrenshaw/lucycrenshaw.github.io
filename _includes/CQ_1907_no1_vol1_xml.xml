Gratulatorium in honorem H. van Herwerden, Utrecht, 1902, pp. 137–142), which
consists of a number of fragments from a papyrus book containing an unknown
epic on the subject of Dionysus and his Indian expedition, is bound up a small
fragment, evidently by a different hand. This (Pap. 2736) I have recently
identified as from the Phaenomena of Aratus; and I therefore publish it here.
</p><p>Apparently no papyrus fragment of this poem has yet been discovered ; there
is, however, at Berlin (Pap. Ber. 5865) a portion of a commentary on Aratus,
which has been published by Maass in his Commentariorum in Aratum Reliquiae,
Berlin, 1898, pp. 556-558.
</p><p>The present fragment is very small, measuring only 52 mm. x 45 mm., and, like
the fragments of the Dionysus epic, is from a codex, not a roll. As the writing
on the verso comes from an earlier portion of the poem than that on the recto, it
follows that the fragment must have belonged to the first half of a folded sheet of
papyrus. On the verso, which contains the beginnings of lines, there is no margin,
the first 2-4 letters of each line being lost; the recto, which contains the ends of
lines, has, in its present state, a margin of 17 mm. The Dionysus fragments illustrate
how broad the margin of a codex might be; and allowing for the lost letters of
the verso and the margin there, it is clear that the margin of the recto must have
been at least double its present breadth, and perhaps considerably more. This is
important for the restoration of the gloss on line 811.
</p><p>The writing, which is a medium-sized uncial, appears to be of the fourth
century. There are, in the extant portion, no marks of punctuation, but there is
one smooth breathing (l. 812) by the original scribe, and two accents (1l. 811 and
NO. I. VOL. I.
</p>
          <pb n="2" rend="H. I. BELL"/><p>
814) have been added later. The ink of the text is of a reddish colour ; but the
first gloss on the recto, which is by a different hand, is written in black ink. The
character of the MS., so far as can be judged from this small fragment, does not
appear to have been very good. In the twenty-six lines so imperfectly represented
there are two (11. 751 and 804) obvious blunders, one line (813) entirely omitted,
and in l. 748 a variant reading which, if the conjectural restoration is correct,
seems also to be a mere blunder.
</p><p>The papyrus has been compared with the editions of Bekker (Berlin, 1828)
and Maass (ib., 1893). In this transcript the portion preserved in the MS. has
been given (except for separation of words) exactly as it stands in the original,
without accents or punctuation marks, except where the original has them.

</p><p>Marginal notes: the first three lines are in a darker ink than the text, and by
a different hand. The $ in the third line was read by Mr. Kenyon, who suggests
that the whole is a note on årwal, and that it ran somewhat as follows :-ai kalov-
μεν[αι άλωαι εξ αέρος] πεπυκνωμένου...] ει δ' εις νέφος ... Perhaps αι καλούμεναι
άλωαι εξ αέρος πεπυκνωμένου συνίστανται, ει δ' εις νέφος μεταβάλλουσι [την
σελήνην κρύπτουσιν ? or χειμών έσται (Κ.) ?]. The μ at the end of 1. 2 is very
doubtful : that in l. 3 is inferred only from a projecting tail.
</p><p>The second note is evidently some case of yarnvain, but its purpose is not
obvious. It can hardly be an alternative reading to, or explanation of, γαλήνης ;
but it may have some reference to the omitted line. It is apparently in the same
hand as the text, though the ink seems slightly darker.

</p><p>Since the above article was written another and much longer fragment of
Aratus has been published in Berliner Klassikertexte, Heft V, ite Hälfte,
pp. 47–54. In this the first, but not the second, of the passages contained in
the British Museum fragment is included.

</p><p>PROFESSOR TUCKER in the C.R. vol. xi. pp. 341 sqq. has revolutionized our
notions of doubtful syllables': we have now learned that such syllables are
normally short, and that lengthening is the licence.
</p><p>I have no quarrel with this general statement of the facts, for I have been at
the pains carefully to record (in iambic senarii only) all the words with doubtful
syllables, and the result, exclusive of augments and reduplications, is: words never
long, 403 ; words short and long, 81; words never short, 80. If we add augments
and reduplications we get 616 words never long.
</p><p>Prof. Tucker gave a list of 183 words (I omit 7 augments and one
reduplication for the present) whose doubtful syllables appear on occasions long.
</p><p>Of these 16 do not occur, and 10 are not long, in iambic senarii, and we are left
with 157. I add four new words, making a total of 161.
</p><p>Half-statistics are dangerous things. It is not enough to record the instances
of lengthening: we must also take account of cases where the syllable is short or
common (i.e. the syllable lies in the first, third, or fifth foot), and if we do this we
shall find quite a new complexion thrown on the matter.
</p><p>I will give the result first: of these 161 words, 80 are never short; 15 are more
often long than short; and 15 are as often long as short. Thus 110 of them may
be lengthened with a perfectly clear conscience (i.e. over 67 per cent.), and 50 per
cent. must always be kept long.
</p><p>The figures for tékvov come out in the proportion 3 short: 1 long. If we
admit this proportion to justify lengthening, we may add 26 to the 110, and 84 per
cent. of the list have no terrors for the iambic writer-he may lengthen them
'habitually.'
I have omitted, as does Prof. Tucker, the Rhesus, Cyclops, and Iphigenia in
Aulis in these calculations. Their statistics are : 62 words never long ; 22 common
only ; 21 short and long ; and 17 long only. Thus 38 appear long on occasions,
of which 17 are never short; 4 more often long than short; and 7 as often long as
short; i.e. 28 may be lengthened and 17 must be.
</p><p>In the matter of augments and reduplications Prof. Tucker's case is
conclusive. The exact figures (in iambic senarii) are: augments, 213 short and
168 common=381, against 8 lengthenings; reduplications, 135 short and 245
common=380, and only one lengthening.
</p><p>Prof. Tucker (p. 341) speaks of the temptations of relvával and ēOvos.'
