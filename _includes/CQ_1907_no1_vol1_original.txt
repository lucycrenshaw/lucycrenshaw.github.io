AN ARATVS FRAGMENT IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
WITH B. M. Pap. 273 (described and in part published by Kenyon in the Album
Gratulatorium in honorem H. van Herwerden, Utrecht, 1902, pp. 137–142), which
consists of a number of fragments from a papyrus book containing an unknown
epic on the subject of Dionysus and his Indian expedition, is bound up a small
fragment, evidently by a different hand. This (Pap. 2736) I have recently
identified as from the Phaenomena of Aratus; and I therefore publish it here.
Apparently no papyrus fragment of this poem has yet been discovered ; there
is, however, at Berlin (Pap. Ber. 5865) a portion of a commentary on Aratus,
which has been published by Maass in his Commentariorum in Aratum Reliquiae,
Berlin, 1898, pp. 556-558.
The present fragment is very small, measuring only 52 mm. x 45 mm., and, like
the fragments of the Dionysus epic, is from a codex, not a roll. As the writing
on the verso comes from an earlier portion of the poem than that on the recto, it
follows that the fragment must have belonged to the first half of a folded sheet of
papyrus. On the verso, which contains the beginnings of lines, there is no margin,
the first 2-4 letters of each line being lost; the recto, which contains the ends of
lines, has, in its present state, a margin of 17 mm. The Dionysus fragments illustrate
how broad the margin of a codex might be; and allowing for the lost letters of
the verso and the margin there, it is clear that the margin of the recto must have
been at least double its present breadth, and perhaps considerably more. This is
important for the restoration of the gloss on line 811.
The writing, which is a medium-sized uncial, appears to be of the fourth
century. There are, in the extant portion, no marks of punctuation, but there is
one smooth breathing (l. 812) by the original scribe, and two accents (1l. 811 and

814) have been added later. The ink of the text is of a reddish colour ; but the
first gloss on the recto, which is by a different hand, is written in black ink. The
character of the MS., so far as can be judged from this small fragment, does not
appear to have been very good. In the twenty-six lines so imperfectly represented
there are two (11. 751 and 804) obvious blunders, one line (813) entirely omitted,
and in l. 748 a variant reading which, if the conjectural restoration is correct,
seems also to be a mere blunder.
The papyrus has been compared with the editions of Bekker (Berlin, 1828)
and Maass (ib., 1893). In this transcript the portion preserved in the MS. has
been given (except for separation of words) exactly as it stands in the original,
without accents or punctuation marks, except where the original has them.

749. The cross-stroke of the e of μέγαν is continuous with the top stroke of
Y, so that the word looks like μεταν.

σει. Maass reads έμπελάει.

753. Only the tops of letters remain, and the readings are doubtful. The
letter read as v looks more like i, there being no trace of the cross stroke.

805. Only the end of the down stroke of a remains, and the has a loop to
the left at the top, so that the whole looks like 0.

812. Smooth breathing by the original scribe.
813. τη μεν ιη ανέμοιο γαληναίης τε δοκεύειν, omitted.
814. Accent by the same hand as in 811.
Marginal notes: the first three lines are in a darker ink than the text, and by
a different hand. The $ in the third line was read by Mr. Kenyon, who suggests
that the whole is a note on årwal, and that it ran somewhat as follows :-ai kalov-
μεν[αι άλωαι εξ αέρος] πεπυκνωμένου...] ει δ' εις νέφος ... Perhaps αι καλούμεναι
άλωαι εξ αέρος πεπυκνωμένου συνίστανται, ει δ' εις νέφος μεταβάλλουσι [την
σελήνην κρύπτουσιν ? or χειμών έσται (Κ.) ?]. The μ at the end of 1. 2 is very
doubtful : that in l. 3 is inferred only from a projecting tail.
The second note is evidently some case of yarnvain, but its purpose is not
obvious. It can hardly be an alternative reading to, or explanation of, γαλήνης ;
but it may have some reference to the omitted line. It is apparently in the same
hand as the text, though the ink seems slightly darker.

Since the above article was written another and much longer fragment of
Aratus has been published in Berliner Klassikertexte, Heft V, ite Hälfte,
pp. 47–54. In this the first, but not the second, of the passages contained in
the British Museum fragment is included.
