Using the xpath search function in XML, I counted the number of characters in each volume of the Classical Qaurterly. I then divided that count into the highest divs "FrontMatter", "Issues", and "Index". Below are the character counts per volume, viewed two different ways. The first shows the total characters per volume and the division of those characters between the 3 divs. The second shows the total character count per volume for each div.
